# BNP Decision Guard

**Knowledge Governance and Authorized Decision Platform**

A web + mobile platform that gives nurses trusted, cited answers **exclusively
from approved hospital PDF documents** — with an AI that refuses instead of
guessing, a governed document approval workflow, a pharmacist-gated dose
calculator, role-based access control, and a complete audit trail.

> When no sufficiently approved source exists, the assistant answers **exactly**:
>
> **«لا توجد وثيقة معتمدة كافية للإجابة. الرجاء الرجوع للمسؤول المختص.»**
>
> Every dose calculation carries the warning:
>
> **«لا يعتمد هذا الحساب دون مراجعة سريرية من المختص.»**

## Architecture

```
apps/
  api/        NestJS + TypeScript — REST API, RAG pipeline, RBAC, audit
  web/        Next.js 16 + Tailwind — 15 protected screens, bilingual EN/AR
  mobile/     Expo React Native — nurse-focused companion app
packages/
  shared/     RBAC matrix, clinical safety strings, lifecycle enums
infra/
  docker/     Dockerfiles + Postgres init SQL
  k8s/        Kubernetes-ready reference manifests
docs/         Architecture, database schema, API reference
```

**Stack**: PostgreSQL 16 + pgvector (embeddings + HNSW index), MinIO
(S3-compatible PDF storage), NestJS 11, TypeORM, Next.js 16, Expo 57,
JWT auth (+ refresh, self-service TOTP MFA), Docker Compose.

**RAG pipeline**: PDF → page-aware extraction → chunking → embeddings →
pgvector → cosine retrieval (**restricted to ACTIVE, non-expired documents**)
→ rerank → threshold check → context-only LLM → citations (document, page,
approval date, confidence) → exact refusal when no source qualifies.

**Pluggable AI providers**: with no API key the platform runs a deterministic
mock embedding provider and an **extractive** mock LLM that can only quote
approved documents — the entire system works offline. Set
`LLM_PROVIDER=openai`, `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` to use
any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (the context-only prompt and refusal gate still
apply).

### Switching to real AI (turn-key)

1. Set `LLM_PROVIDER=openai`, `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai`, `OPENAI_API_KEY=…`
   (optionally `OPENAI_BASE_URL` for any OpenAI-compatible endpoint) and
   restart the API.
2. Every chunk is stamped with the provider that embedded it, and retrieval
   only compares vectors from the **currently configured** provider — vectors
   from different providers live in incompatible spaces. So immediately after
   the switch the assistant **refuses everything** (safe) and the API logs a
   startup warning naming the stale chunks.
3. Re-embed the corpus: sign in as a knowledge manager and call
   `POST /rag/reindex` — it re-extracts, re-chunks and re-embeds every ACTIVE
   document with the new provider and reports per-document results. A document
   that fails keeps its previous chunks (each rewrite is transactional).
4. Ask a question — answers now use real semantic retrieval; citations,
   thresholds and the exact refusal contract are unchanged.

Provider calls carry a hard timeout (`OPENAI_TIMEOUT_MS`, default 30 s) with
one retry on 429/5xx; a provider outage surfaces as a safe error, never a
fabricated answer.

**Document lifecycle**:
`DRAFT → IN_REVIEW → APPROVED → INDEXED → ACTIVE` (+ `REJECTED`, `EXPIRED`,
`INACTIVE`). Only **ACTIVE** documents are retrievable by the AI. Re-uploading
creates a new version and resets the lifecycle to DRAFT. A daily job expires
stale documents (removing them from retrieval immediately) and alerts knowledge
managers 30 days before expiry.

## Prerequisites

- Docker + Docker Compose v2 (that's all for the containerized run)
- For local development: Node.js ≥ 20

## Run locally (Docker Compose)

```bash
cp .env.example .env          # optional — sensible defaults are built in
docker compose up --build
```

| Service      | URL                                            |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Web app      | http://localhost:3000                          |
| API          | http://localhost:4000 (liveness: `/health`, readiness: `/health/ready`) |
| MinIO console| http://localhost:9001 (bnp_minio / bnp_minio_secret) |
| PostgreSQL   | localhost:5432 (bnp / bnp_secret)              |

The API container runs migrations and (with `SEED_ON_BOOT=true`, the default)
seeds roles, demo users, sample approved documents and dose formulas on first
boot.

## Run locally (without Docker for the apps)

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres minio minio-init   # infra only
npm install
npm run build:shared
npm run seed          # migrations + demo data (idempotent)
npm run dev:api       # API on :4000
npm run dev:web       # web on :3000
```

Mobile:

```bash
cd apps/mobile && npm install && npm start
# Android emulator: EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://10.0.2.2:4000 npm start
# Physical device:  EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://<your-LAN-IP>:4000 npm start
```

Store builds (EAS — requires an Expo account; production signing additionally
needs Apple/Google developer credentials):

```bash
cd apps/mobile
npm install -g eas-cli
eas login
eas init                                   # links the project (writes extra.eas.projectId)
eas build --profile preview --platform android   # internal APK
eas build --profile production --platform all    # store builds
```

Profiles live in `apps/mobile/eas.json` — edit each profile's
`EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` to point at your deployed API before building.

## Demo users

| Role                       | Email                  | Password        |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------- |
| Super Admin                | superadmin@bnp.health  | SuperAdmin123!  |
| Hospital Admin             | admin@bnp.health       | HospAdmin123!   |
| Nursing Knowledge Manager  | knowledge@bnp.health   | Knowledge123!   |
| Pharmacist Reviewer        | pharmacist@bnp.health  | Pharmacist123!  |
| CBAHI / Quality Officer    | quality@bnp.health     | Quality123!     |
| Nurse User                 | nurse@bnp.health       | NurseUser123!   |
| Auditor                    | auditor@bnp.health     | Auditor123!     |

*Demo data only — no real patient data is used anywhere in this MVP.*

> **⚠️ These passwords are public, and production now enforces that.** Two
> gates exist because the table above is the single largest credential risk
> in this repository:
>
> 1. **The seed refuses to run with `NODE_ENV=production`** — both in
>    `seed.ts` itself and in the container's start command, which no longer
>    keys on `SEED_ON_BOOT` alone. Override with `SEED_ALLOW_PRODUCTION=true`
>    only for a throwaway demo holding no real data.
> 2. **Any production account still using one of these passwords is disabled
>    at boot** by `DemoAccountGuardService`: `is_active` goes false,
>    `token_version` is bumped (revoking outstanding refresh tokens), and a
>    `SECURITY:DEMO_ACCOUNT_DISABLED` audit row is written. It compares
>    against the *shipped* literal, so an account whose password was rotated —
>    including one seeded from a `SEED_PASSWORD_<ROLE>` override — is never
>    touched. `ALLOW_DEMO_ACCOUNTS=true` opts out, loudly.
>
> On a deployment seeded before this shipped, gate 2 can disable **all seven**
> accounts and lock you out. Provision a real administrator first:
>
> ```bash
> ADMIN_EMAIL=you@hospital.example ADMIN_PASSWORD='<a strong password>' \
>   ADMIN_NAME='Your Name' node dist/scripts/create-admin.js
> ```
>
> The container runs this for you at boot when `ADMIN_EMAIL` and
> `ADMIN_PASSWORD` are set. **The password must be 12+ characters with upper,
> lower, digit and symbol** — if it is rejected the deploy fails deliberately,
> because booting without an administrator would let the sweep disable every
> account and lock you out. Remove `ADMIN_PASSWORD` once you have signed in:
> while it is set, a password you rotate in the app is reset at the next boot.
>
> It creates a SUPER_ADMIN, or resets and reactivates that email if it already
> exists. It refuses weak passwords and refuses every password in the table
> above. Nothing echoes the password back to the log.
>
> For a fresh internet-facing install, set `SEED_PASSWORD_<ROLE>` environment
> variables (e.g. `SEED_PASSWORD_NURSE_USER`) **before first boot** — seeding
> is skip-if-present, so overrides never touch an existing database — or
> rotate every account from the **Users** screen right after deploying
> (`PATCH /users/:id` also revokes that user's outstanding refresh tokens).

## How to upload and approve a PDF

1. Sign in as **knowledge@bnp.health** → **Upload Document** → choose a PDF,
   title, category and expiry date. The document is created as **DRAFT**.
2. On **Approval Workflow**, click **Submit for review** (→ IN_REVIEW).
3. Sign in as **pharmacist@bnp.health** (or quality@ for CBAHI docs) and click
   **Approve** (→ APPROVED). Reject sends it back with a reason.
4. Back as the knowledge manager, click **Index into AI** — the PDF is
   extracted, chunked, embedded into pgvector and becomes **ACTIVE**.
5. Only now can the AI cite it. **Deactivate** (or expiry) removes it from
   retrieval instantly.

## How to ask the AI assistant

Sign in as **nurse@bnp.health** → **Nursing Assistant** (or Drug
Preparation / CBAHI Search, which restrict retrieval to their category).

Every answer includes: short answer, practical steps, warnings, source document
name, page number, document approval date, and a confidence level. Try:

- *“What is the IV paracetamol dose for a patient weighing 50 kg or less?”* → cited answer
- *“What is the chemotherapy protocol for lung cancer?”* → exact Arabic refusal

## Dose calculator

Sign in as a nurse → **Dose Calculator**. Only formulas **approved by a
Pharmacist Reviewer** are usable; draft formulas are rejected by the API.
Output shows the formula source, step-by-step math, max-dose capping,
prescribed-vs-calculated deviation warnings, and always the Arabic safety
warning. Pharmacists manage formulas via `POST /dose/formulas` and
`POST /dose/formulas/:id/approve`.

## Clinical reference inventory

What the assistant can actually cite right now, read straight out of the
database. Two ways in, one implementation:

```bash
GET /documents/inventory            # permission: documents:read
npm run inventory                   # human table
npm run inventory -- --json         # deterministic JSON
```

The route is the one that matters in production: the API container ships
without a shell, so the script cannot be run against the live deployment. The
script is for local use, CI, and any machine that can reach the database.

Per ACTIVE document: title, category, version, approval date, expiry date,
current-version chunk count, superseded chunk count, embedding provider(s),
first/last indexing time — and **whether the assistant can cite it**, with the
reason when it cannot. Plus corpus totals.

The last column is the point. A document can sit at `ACTIVE` in the governance
workflow and still be uncitable — never indexed, past its expiry, or embedded
by a provider that is no longer configured. It looks approved on every screen
and answers nothing, and until this report there was no way to see that
without a SQL client.

**Two fields are reported as `null` because the database does not record
them**, and both are named in `fieldsNotInSchema` so the gap is machine-
readable rather than a footnote:

| Field | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `issuingBody` | `documents` has no issuing-body, publisher or provenance column. **Not** inferred from the title or filename: a guess that is right often enough to be trusted and wrong often enough to mislead is worse than an honest blank. |
| `effectiveDate` | `documents` has no effective-date column. `approvalDate` is reported separately under its own name — it is when *this platform* approved the document, not when an issuing authority made it effective. |

Adding either means a migration and an upload-form field; neither is
synthesised here.

**The JSON carries no generation timestamp**, on purpose: two runs against an
unchanged database produce byte-identical output, so reports diff cleanly
against each other. The human view prints the time in its header, where it
does not contaminate the data. An empty corpus is a supported state, not an
error — it reports zero totals and says outright that the assistant refuses
every question until a document is indexed.

## Tests

```bash
npm test                        # 213 unit tests — mocked repositories, no I/O
npm run test:e2e -w @bnp/api    # 69 integration tests — real HTTP + real Postgres
cd apps/mobile && npm test      # 32 mobile unit tests — separate install
```

**Unit** (`apps/api/src/**/*.spec.ts`) covers: the exact refusal contract,
retrieval thresholding, mock-embedding determinism, chunk/page integrity, dose
math + unapproved-formula rejection + max-dose caps, the RBAC permission matrix
(nurse cannot approve/download, only pharmacists approve formulas, auditor is
read-only, a database-only role grants nothing), upload content validation, the
password-reset token never being returned to the caller, and the production
secret fail-fast.

**Mobile** (`apps/mobile/src/*.spec.ts`) covers `src/api.ts` and `src/i18n.ts`:
tokens reaching the OS keychain and never plaintext storage, the pre-SecureStore
session purge, a 401 refreshing exactly once and replaying with the new token
without looping, session teardown when refresh fails, and the bilingual/RTL
helpers. It runs on `testEnvironment: node` with the two native storage modules
mocked; `apps/mobile` is a separate install, not an npm workspace. The screens
themselves have no runtime coverage — that needs `jest-expo` plus
`@testing-library/react-native`.

**Integration** (`apps/api/test/**/*.e2e-spec.ts`) boots the real `AppModule` —
guards, `ValidationPipe`, exception filter — and drives it over HTTP against a
real PostgreSQL + pgvector. It needs a database:

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres
E2E_POSTGRES_DB=bnp_e2e npm run test:e2e -w @bnp/api
```

It covers the governance chain end to end: a PDF uploaded, refused as a source
while unapproved, moved `DRAFT → IN_REVIEW → APPROVED` (illegal transitions
rejected), indexed into pgvector, then cited in an answer — and refused again
the moment it is deactivated. Plus the auth lifecycle (token revocation on
logout, account lockout blocking a correct password, a reset link that arrives
by mail and is single-use while the token never appears in a response), RBAC
403s on real routes, and the dose-calculator safety gates.

Still not covered: **PDF text extraction** — `pdf-parse`'s bundled pdf.js cannot
run inside a jest process, so that one step is stubbed in the integration suite
and has no automated coverage anywhere. There are also no web or mobile unit
tests.

Continuous integration (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs, on every push and PR:
the dependency scan; lint; the API build + unit tests + migrations +
**integration tests** against a real pgvector service; the web production
build; a **full-stack browser smoke test** that brings the whole stack up with
`docker compose` and drives it with Playwright; and the mobile typecheck,
its own unit tests, and its own dependency-audit gate (critical severity —
the mobile tree is not an npm workspace, so the root scan cannot see it).

The browser end-to-end script (`apps/web/e2e-smoke.mjs`, Playwright) drives, in
one session against a running stack:

- login → cited answer → Arabic refusal → dose calculation
- copy protection and role-aware navigation, each checked in **both**
  directions — a nurse sees no download buttons and no admin nav, an admin and
  a knowledge manager see exactly those, so a locator that quietly matched
  nothing cannot make the nurse's checks pass for the wrong reason
- language switching: `dir`/`lang` on `<html>`, an Arabic nav label, the
  sidebar physically mirroring, and the preference surviving a reload
- responsive layout at phone/tablet/laptop widths in both reading directions,
  asserting no horizontal overflow
- rejected sign-in staying on `/login`
- search and category filtering on the policy library, including the
  no-matches empty state
- the user lifecycle: client-side validation gating submission, create,
  duplicate-email rejection surfaced in the form, and deactivation
- audit filtering, which doubles as the only end-to-end proof that those user
  changes were actually written to the audit trail

CI runs it against a stack started with `docker compose up -d --build`, so it
also guards the quickstart above from regressing. To run it locally, bring the
stack up and:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
node apps/web/e2e-smoke.mjs        # screenshots land in apps/web/e2e-shots/
```

## Environment variables

See `.env.example`. Key ones:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LLM_PROVIDER` / `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` | `mock` | `mock` or `openai` |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | — | required only for `openai` providers |
| `RAG_MIN_SIMILARITY` | `0.25` | refusal threshold |
| `RAG_TOP_K` / `RAG_FINAL_K` | `8` / `4` | retrieval / rerank depth |
| `MAIL_PROVIDER` | `log` | `log` writes reset links to the app log; set `smtp` before real users |
| `MAIL_HOST` / `MAIL_FROM` / `APP_BASE_URL` | — | `MAIL_HOST` required for `smtp`; reset links resolve against `APP_BASE_URL` (defaults to the first `CORS_ORIGINS` entry) |
| `NODE_ENV` | `development` | `production`, `development` or `test`. An unrecognised value refuses to boot rather than silently selecting the development security posture |
| `RAG_MIN_SIMILARITY` | `0.25` | refusal threshold; must be a finite number in `[0, 1]` or the API refuses to boot |
| `SEED_ON_BOOT` | `true` (docker) | seed demo data on API start — ignored when `NODE_ENV=production` |
| `SEED_ALLOW_PRODUCTION` | unset | allow seeding published demo accounts in production |
| `ALLOW_DEMO_ACCOUNTS` | unset | keep default-password demo accounts enabled in production |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_EMAIL` | unset | prefill this email on the login page and show a demo hint (build-time, web) |
| `JWT_SECRET` / `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` | change-me | **must** be rotated in production |

## Security & governance design

See **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)** for the full control list and operational
requirements, and **[docs/production-readiness.md](docs/production-readiness.md)**
for the pilot/production launch checklist — including a "Path to Production"
runbook table naming, for every item still open, whether it's an engineering
task or requires the hospital operator's own credentials/infrastructure/
institutional process. Highlights:

- **Production secret fail-fast**: with `NODE_ENV=production` the API refuses to
  boot if any JWT secret, DB password or S3 secret is missing or left at a
  shipped default.
- **Hardened edge**: `helmet` security headers, per-IP rate limiting with a
  stricter cap on `/auth/*` (brute-force defense, returns 429), an explicit
  `CORS_ORIGINS` allowlist, and a JSON body-size cap.
- **Revocable sessions**: `POST /auth/logout` (and any password change) bumps
  the user's `token_version`, immediately invalidating all outstanding refresh
  tokens.
- **Brute-force lockout**: an account locks for `AUTH_LOCKOUT_MINUTES` after
  `AUTH_MAX_FAILED_ATTEMPTS` failed logins — blocking even a correct password.
- **Self-service password reset**: `POST /auth/forgot-password` (no account
  enumeration) and `POST /auth/reset-password` (single-use token bound to
  `token_version`; rotating the password invalidates every session). The link
  is **emailed** — set `MAIL_PROVIDER=smtp` with `MAIL_HOST` before onboarding
  real users. The default `log` provider writes the link to the application
  log instead of sending it, so the flow works with no mail server but reaches
  nobody; production warns rather than refusing to boot.
- **Safe errors**: a global exception filter returns a uniform envelope and
  never leaks internal 5xx details in production.
- **RBAC**: 7 roles with a central permission matrix (`packages/shared`),
  enforced by a global guard. The matrix is the single source of truth — the
  persisted `role_permissions` rows exist so the UI can display it and are
  never consulted when authorizing a request.
- **Refusal-first AI**: retrieval is hard-filtered to ACTIVE, non-expired
  document versions; sub-threshold matches refuse with the exact Arabic string;
  the mock LLM is extractive (cannot generate beyond context) and the OpenAI
  provider runs under a context-only prompt with the same server-side gate.
- **Audit**: every login, question, answer (incl. refusals), document action,
  dose calculation, permission change and settings edit is recorded with actor,
  IP and before/after metadata.
- **Copy protection**: `documents:download` is withheld from nurses and
  auditors; downloads are short-lived presigned URLs, and every download is
  audited.
- **Answer review**: the **AI Answer Review** screen (`GET /chat/answers`,
  `POST /chat/answers/:id/review`) lets the scientific committee
  (pharmacist/quality/knowledge manager) see every nurse's AI answers and
  approve or flag them — nurses cannot access either endpoint.
- **Bilingual EN / AR with real RTL**: every screen, the shell and both auth
  screens translate, and Arabic mirrors the layout (sidebar, tables, form
  alignment, icon direction) rather than only flipping text. The choice is
  per-user, persisted, and applied before first paint so there is no
  left-to-right flash on load. Not locale-routed — URLs are language
  independent. Arabic keeps Latin digits so doses, page citations and
  timestamps stay comparable against English source PDFs.
- **MFA (TOTP)**: self-service two-step enrolment — `POST /auth/mfa/enroll`
  returns a secret + `otpauth://` URI without arming it, `POST /auth/mfa/enable`
  arms it only after a live code proves the authenticator app holds it, and
  `POST /auth/mfa/disable` requires the account password. Login then returns a
  half-authenticated token exchangeable only at `/auth/mfa/verify`. Adoption is
  per-user; there is no org-wide "require MFA" policy yet.
- **HTTPS-ready**: the API and web containers sit behind whatever TLS
  terminator you deploy (see `infra/k8s/`); no HTTP-only assumptions in code.
- **Encryption at rest**: object storage is S3-compatible — enable SSE/KMS on
  MinIO or your cloud bucket; Postgres supports TDE/disk encryption at the
  infrastructure layer.
- **Dependency vulnerability scanning**: CI hard-fails on any **critical**
  `npm audit` finding. As of the August 2026 audit there are **0 critical, 5
  high and 9 moderate** findings; because the gate only blocks critical, the
  five highs currently pass CI. See `docs/production-readiness.md`. (The
  NestJS 11 and Next.js 16 majors that once blocked some of these have since
  landed — `e0662bd` and `b62443d`.)
- **No public self-registration**: accounts are provisioned by an administrator
  via `POST /users`. Roles are read-only over the API — permissions live in
  `packages/shared/src/rbac.ts`, which is what the guard actually enforces.

## Deployment notes

- **Live deployment**: a Railway project (`bnp-decisionguard`) runs this app today —
  see `infra/railway/README.md` for services, healthchecks, and required env var
  names. It auto-deploys on every push to `main`.
- `infra/k8s/` contains reference Deployments/Services, an `ingress.yaml`
  (cert-manager TLS, two hosts) and a Secret template; point the env at a
  managed PostgreSQL (with the `vector` extension) and an S3 bucket, generate
  real secrets, and set `SEED_ON_BOOT=false`. See `infra/k8s/README.md` for
  the full checklist, including what the manifests deliberately don't cover.
- The API exposes `/health` (liveness, dependency-free) and `/health/ready`
  (readiness — checks Postgres and object storage, 503 if either is down);
  both k8s Deployments and `docker-compose.yml` probe them.
- Images build from `infra/docker/Dockerfile.api` and `Dockerfile.web`.
  CI builds both on every push (the smoke job) but pushes to no registry —
  point it at yours before deploying.
- Scale-out: the API is stateless (JWT), so replicas are safe; the near-expiry
  cron should be limited to a single replica or moved to a Job in production.

## Disclaimer

This MVP is a clinical **decision-support governance** platform demo. It ships
with synthetic demo content, uses no real patient data, and must pass local
clinical, security and regulatory review before any real-world use.
